### Supplementary Material: Monte Carlo Simulation Code

The following Python script was used for Monte Carlo estimation of the minimum number of planets with life:

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters
N_planets = 10**24
T_planets = 7.5 * 10**9
T_life = 0.8 * 10**9
N_attempts = N_planets * (T_planets / T_life)

P_min = 1 / N_planets
P_max = np.sqrt(P_min)

iterations = 10_000
P_life_samples = np.random.uniform(P_min, P_max, iterations)
S_min_samples = N_attempts * P_life_samples

# Compute confidence intervals
S_min_5th = np.percentile(S_min_samples, 5)
S_min_95th = np.percentile(S_min_samples, 95)

print(f"5th percentile: {S_min_5th}")
print(f"95th percentile: {S_min_95th}")
